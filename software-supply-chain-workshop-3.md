## Talks

### Understanding and Preventing Open-Source Software Supply Chain Attacks,[Piergiorgio Ladisa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=it&user=LMHpRBkAAAAJ)), ING

Abstract: In this talk, we explore open-source supply chain attacks, aiming to understand and prevent them. We present a comprehensive, technology-agnostic taxonomy of these attacks and the mapping of existing safeguards that mitigate them. We also detail how third-party dependencies gain execution on downstream systems and suggest automated detection methods for malicious packages within open-source supply chain attacks. First, we present the evaluation of a machine learning-based approach for detecting malicious packages in JavaScript and Python. Then, we present the evaluation of a static approach to identify malicious packages in Java.

### Applying consistent supply chain policies at scale with Minder and Trusty, [Jakub Hrozek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhrozek/?originalSubdomain=se), Stacklok

Managing the security settings of a single repository can be done with a bit of scripting. But what do you do when your organisation has more repositories than developers and every developer team wants to apply their settings to meet their own definition of “secure”? In addition, how do you make sure that the dependencies your repositories are consuming are trustworthy and should be used as the foundation of your software?

In this talk, we’ll demonstrate two tools we have been developing at Stacklok - Minder which addresses the repository sprawl and allows users to secure their repositories by using an extensible policy engine and Trusty which allows to assess the quality of a software package by going beyond metrics like CVEs and instead focusing on how “trusted” a dependency can be.
